# ðŸš€ Welcome to CodeAlpha-Tasks Repository! ðŸ¤–

In this repository, you will find two exciting AI projects that showcase the power of artificial intelligence in different domains. Let's dive into the details of each project and explore how they contribute to safety and creativity using state-of-the-art technologies!

## Projects Overview:
### 1. Fire Detection Using YOLOv8:
![Fire Detection](https://github.com/kohitprajapat/CodeAlpha-Tasks/releases/tag/v1.2+Detection+Using+YOLOv8)

The "Fire Detection Using YOLOv8" project focuses on real-time fire detection and tracking using YOLOv8, an advanced object detection algorithm. Fire incidents can be devastating, and early detection is crucial to minimizing damage. With this AI-powered system, we can quickly identify and track fires, allowing for prompt response and intervention.

#### Key Features:
- Real-time fire detection and tracking.
- Utilizes YOLOv8 for accurate object detection.
- Enhances safety and emergency response capabilities.

### 2. Music Generation Using RNNs:
